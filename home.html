<h1><a name='BuyingDumps'>Choosing And Buying Dumps</a></h1>

<p>First what is “Dumps”, Thats a information that you can write on Magnetic Stripe of Credit Card (Gift Card), to Make a copy(clone) of Real Credit Card of which is stolen from Card Holder.</p>

<p>I assume you already have equipment from previous chapter to write on magnetic stripe and Have Gift Cards.</p>

<p>Now we need dumps!</p>

<p>You can buy dumps in online shop called <a href='https://wuzzup.bz'>wuzzup.bz</a>, that’s the only one real shop who is legit and they have dumps from almost all the world countries. More than 1 million of stolen dumps.</p>

<div class='banner'>
<a href='https://wuzzup.bz'><img src='img/banner.gif' alt='wuzzup.bz'></a>
</div>

<p>You must first register in that shop, registration is Free and available for anyone. Just click Sign Up there. Enter your Username and Password and click “I agree with terms of service”. Click Sign Up! Now you can login to the shop and start buying dumps!</p>

<p>This shop accept multiple payment methods. Easiest is Western Union and Moneygram payment. They also accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, Perfectmoney, Paymer and Lesspay!</p>

<p>How to choose dumps we need? Becouse support of shop is too busy to recommend dumps which is needed for Use is our City I can give some advice.</p>

<h2>METHOD #1:</h2>

<p>When you login to a shop, you can see “Dumps” in top navigation menu, click There.</p>

<p>There You can see BIN(is first 6 digit of credit card number, which mean what bank is it and which type of card is it like GOLD, PLATINUM, CLASSIC)</p>

<p>Example if we live in State – New Jersey, we have branch in our State or even City “1ST CONSTITUTION BANK”, then we CHOOSE Bank this Bank in shop and click Search:</p>

<p>We get -</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>422470</td>
    <td>101</td>
    <td>debit</td>
    <td>VISA CLASSIC</td>
    <td>UNITED STATES</td>
    <td>1ST CONSTITUTION BANK</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>$14.00</td>
    <td>www<br>WWW_MAY_NY</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>That shop have 14 dumps of this bank and each cost $14, We can buy that dumps and download to our computer</p>

<div class='banner'>
<a href='https://wuzzup.bz'><img src='img/banner.gif' alt='wuzzup.bz'></a>
</div>

<h2>METHOD #2:</h2>
<p>Go to DUMPS -&gt; There you can see STATE -&gt; Search our State and Click Search! By that way we receive bins and dumps which is was used in our state. We can buy them.</p>

 

<h2>METHOD #3:</h2>
<p>Go to DUMPS-&gt; Click MIX PACK (Buy BULK) -&gt; There you can buy 100pcs for Cheap price random-&gt; You can use all 100 dumps, some may work, some no... But this way you can test which bins works in your area.</p>

<p>Whatever method we choose, after checkout we will be able to download text file with purchased dumps (Track2 usualy, sometimes Track1+Track2)</p>

 

<h1><a name='HowToTrack1'>How to generate Track1 and Why this Needed</a></h1>

<p>The dumps(dump) contain 2 tracks which we need to write on plastic. Usualy at <a href='https://wuzzup.bz'>wuzzup.bz</a> we receive only TRACK2 (Example - 4474941001145220=150410109604553) but we also need TRACK1 (Example - B4474941001145220^WICKE/DUSTIN ^15041010000455300960000000)</p>

<p>Why we need track1? Sometimes card will not work without track1. And we need to change name to name we need. Example if we have Fake ID under name JOHN SMITH our TRACK1 will be with that ^SMITH/JOHN ^.</p>

<p>If we have only TRACK2 we can generate TRACK1.</p>

<p>We got 4474941001145220=150410109604553</p>

<p>First we must add letter “B”,  then card number 4474941001145220, then add “^”, then name “LASTNAME/FIRSTNAME”, then again “^”, then what we have after = is (150410109604553), and last we must add 6 ZERO (000000), What we have done is TRACK1 - B4474941001145220^SMITH/JOHN” 150410109604553000000</p>

                                                                   
<h1><a name='WriteToPlastic'>Writing dumps on Plastic</a></h1>

<p>We need software to connect our <b>MSR206</b> with computer and Write on Magnetic stripe of our Gift Card.</p>

<p>DOWNLOAD IT HERE – <a href='TheJerm.exe'>THEJERM</a></p>

<p>MSR206 Utility Program v1.8 by TheJerm</p>

<p>What is this program? It's a utility program I wrote to interface with the MSR206 magstripe reader/writer. Why did I write it? I wasn't satisfied with the quality of other programs I tried. I made this program to solve the problems I was having with the other programs. I tried to design it to be very quick, easy and efficient to use but at the same time I wanted it to be very comprehensive so that you would never have to load up another program to use a function that I didn't include. I plan to keep adding more features too. Although I tried to make the program very easy to use, there are some things that are not self-explanatory. That's what this manual page is for. I'll try to explain every feature of the program so you'll have no problems using it.</p>


<h2>Setting It Up</h2>

<p>Before you can use the program you need to make sure it knows what com port your MSR206 is connected to. If the program doesn't find your MSR206 on startup click on the "Settings" tab. Under "Com Port" there is a dropdown box with COM1 through COM16. Choose the port your MSR206 is connected to and then press the "Set Port" button to open that port. The program will then send a command to see if your MSR206 is on that port. If you chose the right port and everything is connected properly the status bar at the bottom of the window will say "MSR206 FOUND ON COM?" where "?" is the number of your com port.</p>

<p>If you choose a port number that doesn't exist on your computer it will say, "INVALID COM PORT". If the port exists but the MSR206 can't be found you will get the message, "NO RESPONSE ON COM?". Make sure all cables are connected properly and try other COM ports.</p>
<div class='banner'>
<a href='https://wuzzup.bz'><img src='img/banner.gif' alt='wuzzup.bz'></a>
</div>

<h2>Actions Tab</h2>

<p>Now that the program can communicate with your MSR206 you're ready to start using it.</p>

<h2>Status Bar</h2>

<p>The status bar is located at the bottom of the window and will give you messages about the functions you use. Its color will give you an idea of the nature of the message. A green bar is for normal messages like indicating when a function completed successfully or displaying information that you requested. A yellow bar means that you started a read, write, or erase function and it's waiting for you to either swipe a card through or abort. A red bar generally indicates an error, like a read error or invalid card swipe. The exception to this color scheme is the LED test under "Settings" which uses the color of the bar to represent</p>

<p>After you connect MSR206 you can copy TRACK1 and TRACK2 that you already bought at “<a href='https://wuzzup.bz'>wuzzup.bz</a>” shop, click <u>Write</u> and Slide our GIFT card through MSR206.</p>

<p><b>FINISH – CLONE OF CARD ARE READY FOR USE! YOU CAN USE AT ANY SHOP(POS)!</b></p>

<div class='banner'>
<a href='https://wuzzup.bz'><img src='img/banner.gif' alt='wuzzup.bz'></a>
</div>
<p>First we need to buy dumps with ORIGINAL TRACK1+TRACK2 at shop <a href='https://wuzzup.bz'>wuzzup.bz</a></p>
<p>Example we bought – <b>601100185904XXXX=19011011000606259802 ; B601100185904XXXX^<u>EURDOLIAN/JOHN NISHAN</u>     ^19011011000606259802</b></p>
<p>Remember this method works only with RARE names!</p>
<p>Like here, we got: First Name – JOHN, LAST NAME – EURDOLIAN, Middle Name – NISHAN</p>
<div class='banner'>
<a href='https://wuzzup.bz'><img src='img/banner.gif' alt='wuzzup.bz'></a>
</div>

<p>Now we need to go to the <a href='http://www.address.com'>http://www.address.com</a>. There you can find “Find People”, enter First and Last name there and click FIND.  The result we can see:</p>
<p>We found one exact match for John Eurdolian.</p> 
<p>So that rare name and that’s good, Then we must click <b>View Full Profile</b></p>
<p>Now we see FULL ADDRESS of This Man + ZIP code they look like that:</p>
<p>Addresses</p>
<ul>
<li>239 Common St Belmont, MA 02478-2944 </li>
<li>38 Audubon Ln Belmont, MA 02478-1102</li>
</ul> 
<p>Anyway we got OUR ZIP – 02478</p>
<p>So we have now DUMPS+ZIP!</p>

<p>Where we can use Dumps+ZIP:</p>
<ol>
<li>iPhone vending machine</li>
<li>Gas station</li>
</ol>

<div class='banner'>
<a href='https://wuzzup.bz'><img src='img/banner.gif' alt='wuzzup.bz'></a>
</div>
<p>First we need to buy dumps with ORIGINAL TRACK1+TRACK2 at shop <a href='https://wuzzup.bz'>https://wuzzup.bz</a></p>
<p>Example we bought – <b>6011001020701234=19011011001602310902 ; B6011001020701234^MCCARTHY/TALENE K         ^19011011001602310902</b></p>
<p>We need to search SSN(Social Security Number) and ZIP for name First name – TALENE, Last name -  MCCARTHY, Middle name - K, In all states of USA. Because name is long and rare there maybe 1-5 variants of different peoples with different ssn.</p>
<p>You can search SSN at multiple services of carders, you can search in jabber service <b>ssn24online</b> <u>ssn24online@jabber.dk</u>, just say him you need to find SSN for rare name. Cost of search is $5 (pay in BTC or some another e-currency).</p>
<p>So now we got SSN for this dump & Zip:<br>
TALENE K MCCARTHY<br>
SSN: 594326719<br>
DOB: 11/29/1969<br>
36 HALL AVE<br>
WATERTOWN, MA 02472-1227<br>
MIDDLESEX COUNTY<br>
(01/2001-Current)</p>

<div class='banner'>
<a href='https://wuzzup.bz'><img src='img/banner.gif' alt='wuzzup.bz'></a>
</div>
<p>
Now we calling to •  U.S. <b>1-800-DISCOVER</b> (<b>1-800-347-2683</b>) (English/Español)
They ask us to enter 4 Last digit of Credit card, We enter 1234 (as on our dump)
Then they ask 4 Last digit of SSN, We enter 6719 (As on SSN number)
Then they ask Zip, we enter 02472
That’s all.  Automatic robot will say you avalaible credit - 19916$, recent transactions and many other options!
Good luck ;)</p>
<p>PS: With this information you have Chance to get a PIN, Like you can find a Phone number of cardholder at http://www.address.com/, and if you fluent in Enlgish language you can Call holder and say that you from Discover and say your last transaction was in Supermarket, for $19.99 and your alailable balance is 19916$, and to approve that Transaction you Need a PIN number. Or some another story.</p>
